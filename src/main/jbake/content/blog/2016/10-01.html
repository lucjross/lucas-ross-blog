<p>Probably any developer developing in Java 8 will eventually run into the issue of wanting to call a method
    that takes a functional parameter, but wanting to give it one that throws a checked exception.
    For example, IntelliJ will be all like,</p>
<p><img class="img-responsive img-thumbnail" src="/img/Screen%20Shot%202016-08-31%20at%203.02.31%20PM.png"/></p>

<p>And then you'll be all like,</p>
<p><img class="img-responsive img-thumbnail" src="/img/200.gif"/></p>

<p>Relax, Titus. First of all, there's really no nice way to pass a lambda that throws a checked exception
    to any of the commonly used methods that take them, such as those provided by Stream.
    You may as well go "back to basics" and use Java 7 syntax. It isn't any less readable.</p>
<pre class="brush: java">
     for (final String s : classNames) {
         Class.forName(s);
     }
</pre>

<p>However, there are ways to make it work, even if it would have to be monstrously cruel
    to other developers reading your code.
    There is a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18198176/java-8-lambda-function-that-throws-exception">well-traveled StackOverflow thread addressing this topic.</a>
    The answer accepted there describes how to use lambdas with exceptions re-thrown as RuntimeExceptions
    (which need not be caught or declared). The point of checked exceptions
    is that you are forced to catch or declare them, thereby mitigating bugs,
    which makes the RuntimeException solution seem kind of self-defeating.
    An interesting idea (the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/27252163/1907186">second answer on the thread</a>)
    is to override the functional method
    with a default one, and add an abstract, non-default method
    (which becomes the one that is implemented by lambdas) that throws something.</p>
<pre class="brush: java">
     @FunctionalInterface
     public interface CheckedConsumer&lt;T&gt; extends Consumer&lt;T&gt; {

         @Override
         default void accept(final T t) {
             try {
                 acceptThrows(t);
             } catch (Exception e) {
                 doThrow(e);
             }
         }

         void acceptThrows(T t) throws Exception;

         @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
         static &lt;E extends Exception&gt; void doThrow(Exception e) throws E {
             throw (E) e;
         }
     }
</pre>

<p>How does that static doThrow method work, by the way?
    <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31316581/a-peculiar-feature-of-exception-type-inference-in-java-8">StackOverflow nails it again</a>.</p>

<p>It may be noted that the <a href="https://projectlombok.org/features/SneakyThrows.html">lombok.SneakyThrows annotation</a>
    may be used to achieve a similar result. I find lombok really exciting in general because of its contribution to
    conciseness in Java code, but I wouldn't recommend using this annotation for a reason I will explain shortly.</p>

<p>Oh and also, why not make acceptThrows generic with an exception type parameter, which would make it more flexible
    (i.e., <code>&lt;E extends Exception&gt; void acceptThrows(T t) throws E</code>)?
    Simply because there is no syntax that would accommodate its use as a lambda, owing to the language spec
    (<a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-15.html#jls-15.27.3">15.27.3</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>A lambda expression is <i>congruent</i> with a function type if all of the following are true:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The function type has no type parameters.</li>
        <li>...</li>
    </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Since the CheckedConsumer interface extends Consumer, it can be used to fix the broken code:</p>
<pre class="brush: java">
    Collections.singleton("abc").forEach((CheckedConsumer&lt;String&gt;) Class::forName);
</pre>
<div class="well">A quick explanation of the above cast expression: a method reference is treated just like a lambda.
    A cast is an explicit way (context clues being another way) for the compiler to infer the target type
    of a lambda expression. If it were missing, as in the initial example,
    the compiler would infer the target type from the forEach method parameter and
    thus assume <code>Class::forName</code> should implement Consumer#accept.</div>

<p>Still, this isn't much better than the technique of rethrowing with RuntimeExceptions because,
    since Iterable#forEach doesn't throw anything, the compiler won't expect the method calling this code
    to throw anything, either. We need it to compile, but for robustness, we still want to require the exception
    to be handled. To this end, you'd have to wrap it with another method that does throw the exceptions
    that other methods should be expected to handle, or that at least throws Exception.</p>
<pre class="brush: java">
     static &lt;T&gt; void forEach(Collection&lt;T&gt; collection, CheckedConsumer&lt;T&gt; consumer) throws Exception {
         collection.forEach(consumer);
     }

     {
         forEach(Collections.singleton("abc"), Class::forName); // Unhandled exception: java.lang.Exception
                                                                // (which is roughly what we want)
     }
</pre>

<p>But, this is definitely nicer than the alternative of using a try-catch inside the lambda,
    having it throw RuntimeException, catching it, and conditionally throwing the cause,
    in order to achieve the same functionality:</p>
<pre class="brush: java">
     try {
         classNames.forEach(s -&gt; {
             try {
                 Class.forName(s);
             }
            catch (ClassNotFoundException e) {
                 throw new RuntimeException(e);
             }
         });
     }
     catch (Exception e) {
         if (e.getCause() instanceof ClassNotFoundException) {
             throw (ClassNotFoundException) e.getCause();
         }
         else {
             throw e; // some other Throwable happened
         }
     }
</pre>

<p>I personally would only ever use the "CheckedConsumer" trick if I had to use a particular
    Exception-throwing lambda in about 1000 different places and it saved me a lot of typing.
    In any case, this illustrates an unfortunate limitation of the Java language.</p>
