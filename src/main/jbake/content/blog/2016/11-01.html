<p>In this blog I'll share some cool discoveries made by folks in the Java performance programming community
    (and subsequently, myself).
    These are issues that are produced by harmless-looking Java code. I'll try to add to this as I find more.</p>

<h2>False Sharing</h2>
<ul>
    <li><i><a href="http://mechanical-sympathy.blogspot.com/2011/07/false-sharing.html">False Sharing</a></i></li>
    <li><i><a href="http://robsjava.blogspot.com/2014/03/what-is-false-sharing.html">What is @Contended and False Sharing?</a></i></li>
</ul>
<p>When multiple threads access one or more variables that share a single block of memory
    (in this case, variables in an array that will end up sharing an L3 cache line),
    write contention occurs, which turns the cache into a performance bottleneck and
    dramatically diminishes performance. I tried this myself with the recent Oracle JDK 8u111
    on an Intel machine. Using the program from <a href="http://mechanical-sympathy.blogspot.com/2011/08/false-sharing-java-7.html">a later article tailored for Java 7</a> (five years ago),
    I was able to reproduce the issue and saw it run ten times slower without the performance fix.</p>

<p>The problem is avoided by "padding" the class for the variables with some unused fields--just as many
    as necessary to cause the objects in memory to break out into their own cache lines.
    Alternatively, the runtime annotation <code>@sun.misc.Contended</code> can be applied
    to a shared variable to override the JVM's automatic memory layout.</p>

<h2>Missing Safepoint</h2>
<ul>
    <li><i><a href="http://psy-lob-saw.blogspot.co.za/2015/12/safepoints.html">Safepoints: Meaning, Side Effects and Overheads</a></i></li>
    <li><i><a href="https://plumbr.eu/blog/performance-blog/logging-stop-the-world-pauses-in-jvm">Logging stop-the-world pauses in JVM</a></i></li>
    <li><a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/mechanical-sympathy/GGByLdAzlPw/cF1_XW1AbpEJ">Forum post by Gil Tene on safepoints</a></li>
</ul>
<p>A safepoint is a point in a thread's execution that a JVM decides is a safe place
    for the thread to pause when in needs to. Safepoints must be reached for "stop-the-world"
    events such as GC. In this article, it's shown that long pauses in execution can happen
    not because of GC itself, but due to a long time-to-safepoint (TTSP), possibly in preparation for GC.
    I ran the code provided by the article and got the following output.</p>
<blockquote>
    testNoAllocations<br/>
    testAllocationsOnHeap<br/>
    No allocation took 50208 with result 500000000000<br/>
    Allocations0<br/>
    Allocations1<br/>
    Allocations2<br/>
    ...
</blockquote>
<p>The "allocations" thread made some progress with its inner loop but ran out of free memory,
    and was forced to pause and wait almost a minute for the other thread to finish,
    negating any benefit that multithreading could have provided.
    In this case the JIT compiler assumed that the no-allocations loop would be fast enough
    that it wouldn't be necessary to add safepoints to it.</p>

<h2>"Hot method too big"</h2>

    <p>Running with the JVM options "-XX:+UnlockDiagnosticVMOptions -XX:+PrintInlining"
        shows all of the method inlining performed by the JIT compiler.
        Doing this with a few apps, I've seen the message "hot method too big" from application code,
        major library methods, and even JDK methods.
        It means that the method has been frequently used but the compiler was not able to inline it
        because it exceeds the threshold for inline-able method size defined by JVM arg "MaxInlineSize" or "FreqInlineSize."</p>
    <p>Is this a big deal? In any case, it's usually a good idea to split large methods into smaller ones
        for all the nice "-ilities" (maintainability, reusability).</p>
