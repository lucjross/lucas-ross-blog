title=Override some methods and delegate others without reimplementing everything

<p>Given this class:</p>
<pre class="brush: java">
 interface Things {
 
     String w();
     long x();
     int y();
     Class&lt;?&gt; z();
 }
</pre>

<p>Suppose you've gotten ahold of an <i>instance</i> of some implementation of this interface.
    You happen to know that that implementation of Things#y does something really awful,
    and you're stuck with that implementation for now because it comes from a library or framework.
    So, you could create a wrapper for that instance like thus:</p>
<pre class="brush: java">
 class ThingsWrapper implements Things {
     
     private final Things things;
     
     ThingsWrapper(final Things things) {
         this.things = things;
     }
  
     @Override String w() { return things.w(); }
  
     @Override long x() { return things.x(); }
  
     @Override int y() {
         // the interface says i'm supposed to get a ratio but the impl provides a percentage
         return things.y() / 100;
     }
  
 	@Override Class&lt;?&gt; z() { return things.z(); }
 }
</pre>
<p>If there are 50 methods on this class, then, yep, we'll have to override 49 methods with nothing but delegations.</p>

<h2>Solution 1: Dynamic Proxy</h2>
<p>A much lazier way to do this is with dynamic proxying. There is a simple way to do this with the JDK:</p>
<pre class="brush: java">
 Things wrapped0 = (Things) Proxy.newProxyInstance(
     Things.class.getClassLoader(),
     new Class&lt;?&gt;[] { Things.class },
     (proxy, method, args) -&gt; {
 
         if ("y".equals(method.getName())) {
             return originalThings.y() / 100;
         } else {
             return method.invoke(originalThings, args);
         }
     });
</pre>
<p>This way we only have to override (or really, tell a proxy factory to do something special with)
    methods that we need overridden and don't have to bother with others.</p>
<p>However, this is really brittle because of the use of a literal String "y" to compare a method name.
    It's also incorrect, strictly speaking, since parameter types also must be compared.
    I prefer another technique illustrated in another blog post. Some AspectJ advice is defined:</p>
<pre class="brush: java">
 @Aspect
 class ThingsAspect {
 
     @Around("execution(int com.example.Things.y())")
     Object aroundY(ProceedingJoinPoint pjp) throws Throwable {
 		// the interface says i'm supposed to get a ratio but the impl provides a percentage
         return (int) pjp.proceed(pjp.getArgs()) / 100;
     }
 }
</pre>
<p>Then, we can throw our instance into an AspectJ proxy factory and get a wrapper instance out of it.</p>
<pre class="brush: java">
 AspectJProxyFactory aspectJProxyFactory = new AspectJProxyFactory();
 aspectJProxyFactory.setTarget(originalThings);
 aspectJProxyFactory.addAspect(ThingsAspect.class);
 Things wrapped = aspectJProxyFactory.getProxy();
 
 Assert.assertEquals(originalThings.y() / 100, wrapped.y());
</pre>
<p>In this screenshot you can see how IntelliJ IDEA provides syntax highlighting
    and navigation markers for well-formed Aspects.</p>

<div class="well">None of these dynamic proxying tools can extend <code>final</code> classes (anything in <code>java.lang</code>).</div>

<h2>Solution 2: @lombok.experimental.Delegate</h2>
<p><a href="https://projectlombok.org/features/experimental/Delegate.html">@Delegate</a>
    is in the lombok "experimental" package, so it may go away in the future.
    It's a less flexible construct, but will be slightly more performant since proxying isn't involved.
    The <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/idea/plugin/6317-lombok-plugin">IntelliJ lombok plugin</a> does support this.</p>
<pre class="brush: java">
 class ThingsWrapper implements Things {
  
     @Delegate(excludes = DelegateExcludes.class)
     private final Things things;
  
     private interface DelegateExcludes {
         int y();
     }
  
     ThingsWrapper(final Things things) {
         this.things = things;
     }
  
     @Override
     public int y() {
         // the interface says i'm supposed to get a ratio but the impl provides a percentage
         return things.y() / 100;
     }
 }
</pre>
