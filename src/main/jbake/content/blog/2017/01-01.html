title=Does it matter whether I return an empty collection or a null one?

<p>This is kind of a philosophical question. Is code A any better or worse than code B?</p>
<div class="panel panel-default">
    <div class="panel-heading">A</div>
    <div class="panel-body"><pre class="brush: java">
 Collection&lt;String&gt; words() {
     Collection&lt;Sentence&gt; sentences = dao.getSentences();
     if (sentences != null) {
         return sentences.stream().flatMap(sentence -&gt; sentence.getWords().stream())
             .collect(Collectors.toList());
     }
     else {
         return Collections.emptyList();
     }
 }
    </pre></div>
</div>
<div class="panel panel-default">
    <div class="panel-heading">B</div>
    <div class="panel-body"><pre class="brush: java">
 Optional&lt;Collection&lt;String&gt;&gt; words() {
     Collection&lt;Sentence&gt; sentences = dao.getSentences();
     if (sentences == null) {
         return Optional.empty();
     }
     else {
         return Optional.of(
             sentences.stream().flatMap(sentence -&gt; sentence.getWords().stream())
                 .collect(Collectors.toList()));
     }
 }
    </pre></div>
</div>

<p>In the absence of documentation, here is how I would interpret two methods like those.</p>
<table class="table">
    <tr>
        <th>Method</th>
        <th>What the method is expected to do</th>
        <th>What the method actually does</th>
        <th>What you get</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>A</td>
        <td>Obtain some X and give you some Y based upon those X</td>
        <td>
            <p>If unable to obtain X, we'll just pretend that we did.</p>
            <p>Thereby, we can pretend that we know what Y exists, and arbitrarily provide some Y (zero of them, perhaps).
                No one will ever know the difference!</p>
        </td>
        <td>Some (zero) Y</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>B</td>
        <td>Obtain some X and give you some Y based upon those X</td>
        <td>
            <p>If unable to obtain X, then we don't know what X exists. Some other source may know, but we don't.</p>
            <p>Therefore we don't know what Y exists either. We'll admit that we don't know, which may be a helpful signal to the user.</p>
        </td>
        <td>null or <code>Optional.empty()</code></td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>You may notice that I'm biased on this issue, but either way, there is a difference.
    For a given scenario, how do you decide whether this matters?
    Basically, how do you know whether it's going to affect a user's (another developer's) experience?
    A few factors may be considered:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Is the method public or protected? If so, there's no telling how an imprecise return value can affect future development,
        so a developer should probably err on the side of returning (or throwing) an indicator of "missing information" as necessary.</li>
    <li>Is the method adapting to a legacy or third-party API? If so, there might be no choice but to accept "null" to mean
        "empty" or vice-versa.</li>
</ul>
<p>In any case, is it really necessary to force developers to ask these questions and have to solve mysteries about
    what a function result is supposed to mean? Providing a clear contract can make this a non-issue:</p>
<pre class="brush: java">
 /**
  * @return  a Collection containing all the Words in all the Sentences. If the Sentences are unknown,
  *          then an empty list will be returned.
  */
 @NotNull
 public Collection&lt;String&gt; words() { ...
</pre>
